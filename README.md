# Renishaw Training Rig

## Executive Summary
This project involved the creation of a training rig for Renishaw's products. The rig was designed from scratch, with meticulous 3D modelling of each component, careful budgeting and scheduling, and detailed wiring based on custom-programmed M-Codes. The final product serves as a valuable tool for training clients and new employees on product installation, wiring, and functionality.

The overall purpose of this project was to create a training rig to produce and then send to clients for training on their products. It also serves as a learning tool for newly hired employees to understand installation, wiring, Renishaw products, and their functionality.

## Project Overview
The training rig frame, made of aluminum extrusion and steel back plates, was designed in a rectangular prism shape with a base plate. The project began with 3D modelling on AutoCAD Inventor. Every external part purchased from suppliers was 3D modelled to resemble the real thing, accurate to size. This also included 3D models provided by suppliers and Renishaw for their lasers, probes, receivers, etc.

## Project Management
As the lead of the project, I handled communication with every supplier, delegated orders, and managed the budgeting, financing, and scheduling aspects. This ensured that all components were positioned correctly for wiring.

## Wiring and Programming
Before wiring, diagrams were created on Multisim to represent the M-Codes that each button and switch should resemble. I programmed the PLC myself to make the M-Codes work accordingly. After creating the diagrams, we began wiring everything from the power supply, to ground rails, to every single probe, laser, receiver until everything was wired and working correctly.
